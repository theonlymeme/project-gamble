As he starts to crawl out of bed a big yawn throws itself out of Samson’s mouth. After getting out of bed, he goes to the bathroom where he gets undressed, and starts the shower. After showering he gets out with drips of water falling on the floor mat under him. He grabs his towel and moves himself to his room again to get dressed in whatever clothes he could find. He finds an oversized shirt with the words thrasher and a pair of dirty jeans that he wore three days ago from his hamper."
