        <h1>The Gamble</h1>
            <h2> By: Timothy Long & Anthony Pasadas</h2>
            <h4>introduction</h4>
        <p> seeps through the metal blinds of Samson’s room waking him from his deep slumber. As he starts to crawl out of bed a big yawn throws itself out of Samson’s mouth. After getting out of bed, he goes to the bathroom where he gets undressed, and starts the shower. After showering he gets out with drips of water falling on the floor mat under him. He grabs his towel and moves himself to his room again to get dressed in whatever clothes he could find. He finds an oversized shirt with the words thrasher and a pair of dirty jeans that he wore three days ago from his hamper.<br>
            Samson’s mother calls for samson to get his breakfast before it gets too cold. Samson opens the door and walks down the narrow hallway of their apartment building to the kitchen. Samson’s mother could be seen cooking some bacon and pancakes with bliss. Samson grabs his 2 pieces of bacon and 2 large pancakes from a plate that was sitting next to his mother. He grabs a paper plate from the pantry and sits down at the table where, already sitting, was a maple syrup bottle and some butter. <br>
            Once Samson was done he put his worn shoes on and left the house, heading for the coal plant where he worked. There he works non-stop, pushing buttons and moving conveyor belt until the bell rings to tell everyone to leave. After that day of work he only managed to get $100, but that is plenty for him because he has a bigger plan.<br>
            Samson walks to the richer part of town, and into a little bar where he sees a poker table. The bar is a popular one, so he has to push people out of his way to get to the poker table in the corner of the room. Once Sampson reaches the table he sees a man with a very big and fluffy jacket that is colored red and has a camo design. <br>
            Samson sits down next to him and tries to shake his hand, but he didn’t even acknowledge Samson. Samson hands in his $100 to the dealer and gets handed five white chips. Everyone has a small smirk to them as they see Samson get handed his chips. Samson knows that everyone has thousands on the table, but that was all the money he had. As the game started Samson has to put in one white chip before the game starts, but gets dealt a great hand and wins quadruple what he had before. <br>
            But Samson wanted more, so he played more and more until he had most of everyone’s money. He thinks that it is enough and it’s getting late so he cashed in his chips. Everyone looks mad, especially the man with the flashy jacket, so before Samson leaves he asked for his name and he responded, Artemas. Samson smiles and grabs his money that he won and leaves the bar. 
<br> Samson reaches his apartment and immediately goes to bed. Only after a short while a loud crash could be heard by Samson’s mother, and she investigates. She walks into the living room to find that Artemas that has broken in. Samson’s mother screams to scare him, sending him into fight or flight mode. Little to the mother’s knowledge, Artemas had a flip knife in his jacket pocket. Artemas, not knowing what he is doing takes the knife out of his pocket and stabs the mother in the stomach three times. He then flees from the scene, leaving the mother to scream for Samson before passing out. As Samson gets up and runs to the living room, he sees a blur of red and something fluffy.</p>

As he is running he can catch a glimpse of the man, Artemas, and Samson starts to run faster. Artemas turns a corner down an alleyway, dropping his pocket knife in the process. Samson stops because he doesn’t want to go into a dark disgusting alleyway without shoes. He sees the knife and picks it up. The knife still had the blood of his mothers on it and the handle was still warm. Samson coming to his senses walks back home still filled with adrenalin from the run. He opens the door to his apartment to find her lifeless body, so Samson decides it’s time to call 9-1-1.
