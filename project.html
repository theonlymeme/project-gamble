        <h1>The Gamble</h1>
            <h4> By: Timothy Long & Anthony Pasadas</h4>
            <h2>introduction</h4>
        <p> seeps through the metal blinds of Samson’s room waking him from his deep slumber. As he starts to crawl out of bed a big yawn throws itself out of Samson’s mouth. After getting out of bed, he goes to the bathroom where he gets undressed, and starts the shower. After showering he gets out with drips of water falling on the floor mat under him. He grabs his towel and moves himself to his room again to get dressed in whatever clothes he could find. He finds an oversized shirt with the words thrasher and a pair of dirty jeans that he wore three days ago from his hamper.<br> <br>
            Samson’s mother calls for samson to get his breakfast before it gets too cold. Samson opens the door and walks down the narrow hallway of their apartment building to the kitchen. Samson’s mother could be seen cooking some bacon and pancakes with bliss. Samson grabs his 2 pieces of bacon and 2 large pancakes from a plate that was sitting next to his mother. He grabs a paper plate from the pantry and sits down at the table where, already sitting, was a maple syrup bottle and some butter. <br> <br>
            Once Samson was done he put his worn shoes on and left the house, heading for the coal plant where he worked. There he works non-stop, pushing buttons and moving conveyor belt until the bell rings to tell everyone to leave. After that day of work he only managed to get $100, but that is plenty for him because he has a bigger plan.<br> <br>
            Samson walks to the richer part of town, and into a little bar where he sees a poker table. The bar is a popular one, so he has to push people out of his way to get to the poker table in the corner of the room. Once Sampson reaches the table he sees a man with a very big and fluffy jacket that is colored red and has a camo design. <br> <br>
            Samson sits down next to him and tries to shake his hand, but he didn’t even acknowledge Samson. Samson hands in his $100 to the dealer and gets handed five white chips. Everyone has a small smirk to them as they see Samson get handed his chips. Samson knows that everyone has thousands on the table, but that was all the money he had. As the game started Samson has to put in one white chip before the game starts, but gets dealt a great hand and wins quadruple what he had before. <br> <br>
            But Samson wanted more, so he played more and more until he had most of everyone’s money. He thinks that it is enough and it’s getting late so he cashed in his chips. Everyone looks mad, especially the man with the flashy jacket, so before Samson leaves he asked for his name and he responded, Artemas. Samson smiles and grabs his money that he won and leaves the bar. 
<br> <br> Samson reaches his apartment and immediately goes to bed. Only after a short while a loud crash could be heard by Samson’s mother, and she investigates. She walks into the living room to find that Artemas that has broken in. Samson’s mother screams to scare him, sending him into fight or flight mode. Little to the mother’s knowledge, Artemas had a flip knife in his jacket pocket. Artemas, not knowing what he is doing takes the knife out of his pocket and stabs the mother in the stomach three times. He then flees from the scene, leaving the mother to scream for Samson before passing out. As Samson gets up and runs to the living room, he sees a blur of red and something fluffy.</p>

Samson stops because he doesn’t want to go into a dark disgusting alleyway without shoes. He sees the knife and picks it up. The knife still had the blood of his mothers on it and the handle was still warm. Samson coming to his senses walks back home still filled with adrenalin from the run.

I’m going to pick you up and we will head to the funeral, then after you will stay with me until you get a house of your own. I hope that’s okay?”Samson responds with a subtle hum of approval, and they plan for the pick up.  Samson gets his black suit that he borrowed from his friend, and he gets picked up in a sleek new minivan that Uncle Jack just bought. Uncle Jack's children were in the back playing with toy planes and scribbling on paper, while his wife was in the front seat reading a book. 
As the children get more rowdy Jack would look in the rear view mirror and tell them to settle down. Samson couldn’t hear his thoughts because the children were drowning out all noise, until Uncle Jack made them be quiet. 
As they arrived at the funeral, Samson began to cry as all the fun thoughts of him and his mother started to flood his mind. He would miss her cooking, her kindness, and her motherly love were all lost because of a knife. Samson didn’t want to get out of the avn because he didn’t want the others too see him cry. Uncle Jack understood and took the children away from him so he could cry in peace. 
When the funeral was done Samson’s tears still rolled down his cheeks. Uncle Jack told everyone to get back in the van, and he drove to his house next to the Peterson Elementary School.
\n \n After a week of being at Uncle Jack’s house, Samson started to calm down, and not cry as much. Samson was sitting on the couch watching a children's program that Uncle Jack’s children had on. He could hear Uncle Jack and his friends playing something at the table, they were chatting so loudly that it was echoing through the house.`,

Samson looked down at the blood that dried into the carpet and decided that he didn’t want to be there anymore. So Samson took a walk to the park and sat at the swings to cry, leaving his phone at home. 
	As he sat there, he could hear the roar of cars on the highway in the distance and started to cry. Being on the swing reminded of him getting pushed on the swing by his mother when he was young. He jumped off and decided that the park would be too much, so he walked back to the apartment. 
	As he arrived to the steps of the house that reminded him of his mother waving at him at the top of the stairs and he started to cry again. He sat at the bottom of the stairs and cried until a black minivan arrived to pick him up. A man stepped out of the driver's seat and as he came into Samson’s view he realized that it was Uncle Jack. 
	Uncle Jack knelt down to met Samson’s eyes and comforted him. Uncle Jack shared a hug with Samson, and after a while Samson was ready to go into the van. Uncle Jack took Samson to his house where he would stay. Uncle Jack’s house is right next to Peterson Elementary School, and that was the elementary school Samson went too when he was young.

	\n After a couple games Samson hasn’t won, but the next hand he was given was going to be a winner. Samson plays a low amount first, then the cards flip and he has three pairs. He bids a slightly higher amount. Then the final cards flip and suddenly he goes all in, making everyone know that he may have a good hand. 
	\n Two of Jack’s friends call him while the other fold, including Uncle Jack. In one turn Samson was able to go from the lowest amount at the table to the highest amount at the table. Before they knew it dinner was being made by Uncle Jack’s wife and they had to clear the table. Jack’s friends and their spouses all sat down at the large table to begin eating the feast that Jack’s wife has prepared. 
	\n Everyone grabbed a spoon full of mashed potatoes, and Jack’s children grabbed the two turkey legs before anyone else. The room was boisterous and the clanking of silverware was muffled by the sounds of laughter and enjoyment. After everyone rinsed their dishes and put them next to the sink. Everyone goes and sits down on the couch except for Uncle Jack and Samson. Uncle Jack wants Samson to take a trip to Vegas and gamble there.

\n Uncle Jack agrees but is adamant about gambling with him, So Uncle Jack brings his friends over once a week and they have a gambling night. In no time Samson forgives Artemas and what he did,and he visited his mother’s grave every week to change out the flowers. Samson goes on to live a fulfilling life with happiness and a wife that loves him.

	\n So Uncle Jack lifted himself up from the table, grabbed the football, And told Samson to head into the back yard. They start throwing the pigskin around, during Uncle Jack has a deep conversation about Samson’s mother. After Samson knows that being angry won’t bring his mother back, so he forgives Artemas for his actions done that day. Samson, every week since, would go to his mother's grave to change the flowers.
